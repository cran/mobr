\title{Randomly sample of a relative abundance distribution (RAD)
to produce an expected species abundance distribution (SAD)}
\usage{
get_rand_sad(rad, N)
}
\arguments{
\item{rad}{the relative abundance of each species}

\item{N}{the total number of individuals sampled

Randomly subsampling an RAD with replacement produces an SAD that is of a
similar functional form (Green and Plotkin 2007) but with overall species
richness equal to or less than the relative abundance distribution.
