\title{Number of individuals corresponding to a desired coverage (inverse C_hat)}
\usage{
invChat(x, C)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{integer vector (species abundances)}

\item{C}{coverage value between 0 and 1}
}
\value{
a numeric value which is the number of individuals for a given
level of coverage \code{C}.
}
\description{
If you wanted to resample a vector to a certain expected sample coverage, how
many individuals would you have to draw? This is C_hat solved for the number
of individuals. This code is a modification of INEXT's internal function
`invChat.Ind` (Hsieh et al 2016).
}
\examples{
data(inv_comm)
# What sample size corresponds to an expected sample coverage of 55\%?
invChat(colSums(inv_comm), 0.55)
