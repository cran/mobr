\title{Calculate species richness for a given coverage level.}
\usage{
calc_S_C(x, C_target = NULL, extrapolate = TRUE, interrupt = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a site by species matrix or a species abundance distribution}

\item{C_target}{target coverage between 0 and 1 (default is NULL). If not
provided then target coverage is computed by \code{\link{calc_C_target}}}

\item{extrapolate}{logical. Defaults to TRUE in which case richness is 
extrapolated to sample sizes larger than observed in the dataset.}

\item{interrupt}{logical. Should the function throw an error when \code{C_target}
exceeds the maximum recommendable coverage?}
}
\value{
numeric value which is the species richness at a specific level of 
coverage.
}
\description{
This function uses coverage-based rarefaction to compute species richness.
Specifically, the metric is computed as the

\examples{
data(tank_comm)
# What is species richness for a coverage value of 60\%?
calc_S_C(tank_comm, C_target = 0.6)
