\title{Calculate expected sample coverage C_hat}
\usage{
Chat(x, m)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{integer vector (species abundances)}

\item{m}{integer a number of individuals that is smaller than observed total
community abundance.}
}
\value{
a numeric value that is the expected coverage.
}
\description{
Returns expected sample coverage of a sample `x` for a smaller than observed
sample size `m` (Chao & Jost, 2012). This code was copied from INEXT's internal
function \code{iNEXT::Chat.Ind} (Hsieh et al 2016).
}
\examples{
data(inv_comm)
# What is the expected coverage at a sample size of 50 at the gamma scale?
Chat(colSums(inv_comm), 50)
}
