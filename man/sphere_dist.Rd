\title{Internal function for distance matrix assuming inputs are longitude and
latitudes on a spherical Earth.}
\usage{
sphere_dist(coords, r = 6378.137)
}
\arguments{
\item{coords}{a matrix with longitudes and latitudes in decimal degrees. The
longitudes should be provided in the first column (they are the
x-coordinate) and the latitudes should be provided in the second column
(they are the y-coordinate).}

\item{r}{the radius of the Earth, defaults to 6378.137 km}
}
\value{
distance matrix between all pairwise coordinates.
}
\description{
This calculation uses the Haversine method of computing great
  circle distances in kilometers on a spherical Earth (r = 6378.137 km). This
  code was taken from fields::rdist.earth by Doug Nychka, John Paige, Florian
  Gerber.
