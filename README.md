# Measurement of Biodiversity in R 

This repository hosts an R package that is actively being developed for 
estimating biodiversity and the components of its change. The key innovations of
this R package over other R packages that also carry out rarefaction (e.g.,
`vegan`, `iNext`) is that `mobr` is focused on 1) making empirical comparisons between 
treatments or gradients, and 2) our framework emphasizes how changes in 
biodiversity are linked to changes in community structure: the SAD, total
abundance, and spatial aggregation. 

The concepts and methods behind this R package are described in three publications.

## Installation

The easiest option is to install the package directly from GitHub using the package `devtools`. If you do not already have `devtools` installed then need to install it.

```r
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
```

Now that `devtools` is installed you can install `mobr using the following R code:

```r
install_github('MoBiodiv/mobr')
```

Note: the installation may take some time due to numerous dependencies. We are 
working on reducing the number of dependencies. 

## Examples

The package [vignette](https://github.com/MoBiodiv/mobr/blob/master/vignettes/mobr_intro.pdf)
provides a useful walk-through the package tools, but below is some example code
that uses the two key analyses and related graphics. 

```r
library(mobr)
data(inv_comm)
data(inv_plot_attr)
inv_mob_in = make_mob_in(inv_comm, inv_plot_attr, coord_names = c('x', 'y'))
inv_stats = get_mob_stats(inv_mob_in, 'group')
plot(inv_stats)
inv_deltaS = get_delta_stats(inv_mob_in, 'group', ref_level='uninvaded',
                             type='discrete', log_scale=TRUE, n_perm = 5)
plot(inv_deltaS, 'b1')
```
